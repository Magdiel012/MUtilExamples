# MUtilExamples

This repository contains a few usage examples for [the MUtil ZScript library](https://github.com/Magdiel012/MUtil). Each root folder contains a standalone mod that showcases the usage example.

As of now, the examples include:
- weathereffects: a highly-optimized weather system designed with MUtil's sector triangulation features lifted from an upcoming project.

Examples may be tested by cloning or otherwise obtaining the repository contents and opening each folder with GZDoom. All examples require GZDoom 4.10.0 or higher.
